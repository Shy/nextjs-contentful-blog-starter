This is an example repository for you to use to create a new blog site using Next.js and Contentful, using Contentful's GraphQL API.

[Read more about the GraphQL API](https://graphql.contentful.com).

## Getting set up

Fork the repository to your GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.

```bash
#using git
git clone git@github.com:whitep4nth3r/nextjs-contentful-blog-starter.git

#using the GitHub CLI
gh repo clone whitep4nth3r/nextjs-contentful-blog-starter
```

## Configuring your development environment

### Install dependencies

In a terminal window, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies with npm.

```bash
cd nextjs-contentful-blog-starter
npm install
```

### Set your environment variables

At the root of the project, create a new `.env.local` file. Add the following environment variable names to the file:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

### Using example content

If you'd like to view some example content in your development environment to get a feel for how it works, you can use the provided credentials in `env.local.example` which will connect your code to the example space provided by Contentful.

### Using your own Contentful account

To get started with your own Contentful space, [sign up for free](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/).

Create a new space inside your Contentful account. Go to Settings > General Settings, and make a note of your space ID.

Add your space ID and access token to your `.env.local` file.

## Importing the starter content model and content into your own Contentful space

To get you up and running quickly on your own version of the application, you can use the Contentful CLI to import the content model and the example content from the starter into your own Contentful space â€” without touching the Contentful UI!

### Install the Contentful CLI

```bash
#using homebrew
brew install contentful-cli

#using npm
npm install -g contentful-cli

#using yarn
yarn global add contentful-cli
```

### Authenticate with the CLI

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
contentful login
```

A browser window will open. Follow the instructions to log in to Contentful via the CLI.

### Import the content model only

The following command in your terminal, ensuring you switch out SPACE_ID for your new space ID.

```bash
cd nextjs-contentful-blog-starter/setup

contentful space import --space-id SPACE_ID --content-file content-model.json
```

Refresh Contentful in your browser, navigate to the content model tab, and you'll find the content types have been imported into your space.

```bash

```

Refresh Contentful in your browser, navigate to the content model tab, and you'll find the content types have been imported into your space.
